# Fallout-4-Texture-Resizer
My first C# program!

The user is presented with a series of adjustable rules, allowing you to define texture resolutions to be resized to another user-defined resolution. Only textures that match the source resolutions will be resized to the target one. Any that don't meet the wanted resolutions are skipped and not processed.
